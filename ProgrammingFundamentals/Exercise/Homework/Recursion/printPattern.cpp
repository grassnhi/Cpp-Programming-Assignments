/*
Given a positive number, print following a pattern without using any loop.

Input: n = 16

Output: 16, 11, 6, 1, -4, 1, 6, 11, 16 (has no space at the end)

Input: n = 10

Output: 10, 5, 0, 5, 10 (has no space at the end)

We basically first reduce 5 one by one until we reach a negative or 0. 
After we reach 0 or negative, we one add 5 until we reach n.

Note: Please note that you can't using key work for, while, goto (even in variable names, comment).

You can implement other recursive functions if needed.

For this exercise, we have #include <iostream> and using namespace std;
*/

#include <iostream>

using namespace std

void printPattern(int n){
	if (n == 0 || n < 0){
        cout << n << " ";
       
    }
     
    cout << n << " ";
    
    printPattern(n-5);
 
    cout << n << " ";
}

int main(){
    cout << printPattern(16);

    return 0;
}
